      <div class="article" contenteditable="true"> In 1928, Turing became interested in relativity, and it was at this time that Alan met Christopher Morcom, and everything changed for him. And it was Morcom's death that prompted Turing to get further involved and motivated to do what Morcom could not.<br/><br/> Turing questioned how the human mind was embodied in matter, and whether this matter was released after death.<br/><br/> This led him to study twentieth century physics where Alan began to question whether quantum mechanical theory affected the state and his questions of mind and matter.</div>

      <div class="article" contenteditable="true">The eliminative materialist view is seductive for several reasons, but one that I suggest has to do with the nature of consciousness itself. Consciousness is, in my understanding, not a function or form*, but the direct appreciation of and participation in form-functions. I suggest that what we perceive of the public universe is only half of the universe; the half that has, for us, already been made explicit as an effect. In the jargon of Quantum Mechanics, the wavefunction has collapsed, or become decoherent.<br/><br/>The working assumption for QM collapse is superposition, in which all of the possible outcomes are present as probabilistic potentials, until measurement freezes the potential into the actual. Given that the letter psi is often used as notation for the wavefunction. &#936;, I propose that a sideways psi &#140; can help illustrate the orthogonal relation which awareness (not human awareness, but awareness on the subatomic level as well) has to measurement. I call this symbol Qui' (who).<br/><br/>So no, I do not think that consciousness is merely physical, I think that consciousness is physics itself.<br/></br/>*human consciousness relies on functions and forms to define the human qualities of consciousness, but awareness itself can only realistically be present beneath form or not present in the universe at all.<br/><br/>I would not be surprised if dark matter, dark energy, and a lot of odds and ends in astrophysics and perception will eventually make sense once we factor in ... sense.<br/><br/>I think that the sudden need for so much dark matter and energy should be a clue that we are holding on to our model of nature too tightly and beginning to lose nature itself.<br/><br/>
