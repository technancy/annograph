  <div id="article" contenteditable="true">And this, our life, exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything. Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once. As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words. <br/><br/> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</div>
